# Readmission-Prediction-for-Diabetic-Patients
The primary objective of the project is to be able to predict if a diabetic patient will be readmitted to the hospital. In the context of this dataset readmission is in three categories: greater than 30 days, less than 30 days, and “No”. The dataset contains variables related to diagnosis, secondary diagnosis, and variables containing information about medication prescribed to the patients while admitted to the Hospital . The Target variable categories "<30 days", and "No" were combined to form the categories "Yes", "No".
